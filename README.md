# Equidecomposability2d

A demonstration of equidecomposability in two dimensions. This is the theorem that given two polygons of equal area, one can be transformed into the other using only a series of cuts, translations, and rotations. See [Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%E2%80%93Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien_theorem) for more info.
