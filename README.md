# Equidecomposability2d

*A demonstration of equidecomposability in two dimensions.*

Equidecomposability is the theorem that given two polygons of equal area, one can be transformed into the other using only a series of cuts, translations, and rotations. The theorem is demonstrated by animating the transformation of a drawn polygon into a square with the same area. If any polygon can be transformed into a square then any polygon can be transformed into any other polygon with the same area through the square. See [Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%E2%80%93Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien_theorem) for more info.

## Usage

- Left click to add a vertice (do this n - 1 times, where n is the number of sides in the desired shape)
- Right click to close the shape (do this the last time)
- Make sure you don't left or right click on top of another vertice (the geometry will become corrupted)

Open the html file in a web brower or just go to the [Github Pages deployment](https://joyal-mathew.github.io/equidecomposability2d/) to try it out.
