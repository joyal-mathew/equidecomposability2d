# Equidecomposability2d

*A demonstration of equidecomposability in two dimensions.*

Equidecomposability is the theorem that given two polygons of equal area, one can be transformed into the other using only a series of cuts, translations, and rotations. The theorem is demonstrated by animating the transformation of a drawn polygon into a square with the same area. If any polygon can be transformed into a square then any polygon can be transformed into any other polygon with the same area through the square. See [Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%E2%80%93Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien_theorem) for more info.
